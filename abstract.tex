In this work, we explore some connections between two areas of Probability Theory: finite free probability and the theory of stochastic processes. The connection is established through the application of both fields to random matrices. Some basic definitions and results are presented in the first chapter. The second chapter introduces the most common application of stochastic processes to the study of random matrices: eigenvalue processes. The third chapter provides an overview of finite free probability theory, focusing on the relationship between expected characteristic polynomials and the convolution of polynomials. In the final chapter, we connect these ideas by considering the expected characteristic polynomial of a matrix-valued stochastic process. We demonstrate that the roots of these characteristic polynomials satisfy differential equations that resemble the stochastic differential equations of matrix-valued stochastic processes discussed in the second chapter.
