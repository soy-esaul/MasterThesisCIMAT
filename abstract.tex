In this work we explore some connections between two areas of Probability Theory; finite free probability and the theory of stochastic processes. The connection is given through the application of both fields to random matrices. Some basic definitions and results are exposed in the first chapter. The second one is an introduction to the most common application of stochastic processes to the study of random matrices; the eigenvalue processes. The third chapter  is a primer on the ideas of finite free probability theory as a relationship between expected characteristic polynomials and convolution of polynomials. In the last chapter, these ideas are related when we consider th expected characteristic polynomial of a matrix-valued stochastic process. We show that the roots of these characteristic polynomials satisfy differential equations that are similar to the stochastic differential equations of matrix-valued stochastic processes in the second chapter.
