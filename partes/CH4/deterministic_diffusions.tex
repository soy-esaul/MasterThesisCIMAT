\section{Deterministic eigenvalue processes for matrix-valued diffusions}

Now that we have shown the construction of a matrix-valued process whose eigenvalue is the deterministic Dyson Brownian motion, we generaliza the result to get processes with a deterministic spectrum that can follow the dynamics of any eigenvalue process with the form \eqref{eq:gen_dyson}.

\begin{theorem}

    Let $Z$ be a process with covariation $\d Z_{ij}\d Z_{kl} = (\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} + \delta_{il}\delta_{jk} - 2\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}\delta_{ik} )\d t$ and no finite variation part, which means $Z$ is a symmetric matrix with independent Brownian motions in its entries, except for the diagonal, where $Z_{ii} = 0$. Let $X$ be a matrix valued process such that  $X = \trans H \Lambda H$ and it satisfies the stochastic differential equation
    
    
    \begin{equation}
        \trans{H}\d X(t)H = g(X(t)) \d Z(t) h(X(t)) + h(X(t)) \d \trans{Z(t)} g(X(t)) + b(X(t))\d t, \label{eq:deterministic_matrix_diffusion}
    \end{equation}

    Then the eigenvalue process $\Lambda$ satisfies

    \begin{equation}
        \d \lambda_i = \biggl( b(\lambda_i) + \sum_{k\neq i} \frac{G(\lambda_i,\lambda_k)}{\lambda_i - \lambda_k} \biggr)\d t.
    \end{equation}

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}


These results can be particularized for any matrix-valued diffusions. Especially, we are interested in the Wishart and Jacobi processes. We give the proofs for these as a corollary to last Theorem.
