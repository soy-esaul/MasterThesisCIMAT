\chapter{Deterministic eigenvalue processes for matrix-valued processes}

In this last chapter, we give a relationship between finite free probability and the eigenvalues of matrix-valued stochastic processes. In the first section, we construct a matrix process whose eigenvalues evolve according to the dynamics of the Dyson Brownian motion without the martingale part. We call this process the deterministic Dyson Brownian motion. In the second section, we construct a similar matrix-valued process whose spectrum evolves according to the finite variation part of equation \eqref{eq:gen_dyson}. We are especially interested in the deterministic versions of the Wishart and Jacobi processes. In the third section, we relate these processes with finite free probability by showing that the convolution of certain polynomials satisfies differential equations that ultimately lead to the conclusion that their roots follow similar dynamics to the deterministic version of the eigenvalue processes. This constitutes the main result of this work.
