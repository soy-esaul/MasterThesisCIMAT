\chapter{Finite Free Probability} \label{ch:finite_free}

This chapter introduces the main ideas in finite free probability theory. In the first section we give the definition of three polynomial convolutions and some classic orthogonal polynomial ensembles. This section is purely algebraic and it is not related to probability. In section two, we present the definition of minor orthogonality, one of the central ideas in finite free probability. This is also the section in which we state initial relations between random matrices and plynomial convolutions. In the third section, we link finite free probability to free probability by defining the $\mathcal R_d$ transform, then we use the precedent contents to find polynomials related to some ``finite free distributions'' and the corresponding limit theorems.
