\chapter{Finite Free Probability} \label{ch:finite_free}

In this chapter, we introduce the main concepts in finite free probability. In the first section we introduce the definition of polynomial convolutions and some polynomial ensembles. This section is purely algebraic and it is not related to probability. In section two we introduce the concept of minor orthogonality which is central to finite free probability. This is also the section in which we state initial relations between random matrices and convolutions of polynomials. In the third chapter, we introduce the $\mathcal R_d$ transform, which relates finite free probability to free probability, we also use this transform to prove the Finite Free Central Limit Theorem.
